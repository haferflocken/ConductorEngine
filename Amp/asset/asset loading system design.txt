A generalized asset loader has the following requirements:
- Different loading functions can be registered. Loading functions operate on file paths and return an asset.
- The type of asset can be determined by file extension.
- Assets must be able to be loaded and unloaded on-demand.

Nice to haves:
- A set of assets that have changed on disk should be maintained so they can be hotloaded when appropriate.
- Assets don't move around in memory, even when hotloaded.

Knock on requirements:
- Each asset type needs a simple allocator (Collection::LinearBlockAllocator)
